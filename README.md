# Prompt Engineering

Prompt engineering is the discipline of designing inputs that steer AI models to produce accurate, useful and consistent results.

It relies on understanding how models like GPT, Claude and Gemini interpret and predict language, and on applying techniques that shape their behaviour. These include clear instructions, relevant context, well chosen examples and sensible parameter settings.

The practice makes capabilities and limits visible, which leads to safer and more reliable systems. It also makes outputs more predictable and better aligned with intent.

This repository is my working notebook. It captures practical notes, patterns and experiments, and it will grow as the practice matures and evolves.
